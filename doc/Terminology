SCENARIO    - the .argos file for the simulator (sometimes also called mission)
EXPERIMENT  - a .txt file containing information on how to execute a set of localsearches that belong together
              (in json format), can describe multiple SETUPs
SETUP       - the entirety of information needed to describe one execution of the localsearch
              (usually CONFIGURATION and some additional details like job_name or overwriting parameters)
CONFIGURATION - a .ini file that contains information on how to execute a single localsearch

LOCALSEARCH - a single execution of the program (one initial controller, improved for some time)
EXECUTE     - regardless of local, remote or distributed execution
RUN         - execute the program locally
SUBMIT      - submit an execution to a scheduler (on the cluster)
